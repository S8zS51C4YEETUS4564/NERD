# Introduction

The simplest definition of a 'mu' library is:

a dual-public domain/MIT-licensed C library whose source code and dependencies are stored entirely in one file.

It is up to the user to decide whether or not a mu library would be better to use in comparison to a traditionally structured project depending on the user's circumstances. Id est, use them if you like, don't if you don't.

# General structure

There are certain general structure choices made in mu libraries. They're not strict rules, but mu libraries almost always follow them, and can safely be assumed unless otherwise specified within the documentation for the respective library.

## Header/Implementation macros

mu libraries are split into two general parts within the single file: header and implementation.

The header provides what is essentially the interface for the library's usage, defining only the things that are necessary to use it. The header's contents are automatically defined upon inclusion of the file, using a macro (usually formatted like `MUX_H`) to check if it hasn't been defined yet and define it if so.

The implementation provides the actual source code that makes the library function (99% just actually providing the code for the defined functions). The implementation is triggered by a manual macro defined before inclusion of the file (usually formatted like `MUX_IMPLEMENTATION`), and, if this macro goes undefined, the actual source code for the library will never be provided and will most likely cause errors and/or warnings.

Noe that both sections provide their respective section for its included libraries (ie, if the library muX has a dependency on muY, the header for muY will be stored in the header section of muX and the implementation for muY will be stored in the implementation section of muX). If a library's header/implementation section is already defined, it will be skipped, but a check on a possible version mismatch will be performed and will throw a warning. This functionality is overridable by defining MU_CHECK_VERSION_MISMATCHING.

## C/C++ standards and general compiler compatability

mu libraries usually follow both the C99 and C++11 standards. They're tested for compilation with gcc, clang, g++, and clang++, but tested rarely with MSVC due to its difficulty to use through the terminal and its inaccessibility (or impracticality to access) through non-Windows operating systems.

Note that I hate Microsoft. (Except for you, Raymond Chen)

## Usual function format

The average function format in mu libraries goes like this:

```
MUDEF RETURNTYPE mu_SUBJECT_THINGBEINGDONE(muxResult* result, ...)
```

In particular, almost all functions begin with `muxResult* result` as their first parameter. This is a pointer to a result enumerator to check for the result of the function (see the result enumerator section). This can safely be passed as `MU_NULL_PTR` (or just 0) if you wish to not check for the result of the function.

## Initiation / Termination structuring

The lower level and more simplistic mu libraries usually have minimal overhead, and functions are usually able to be called without interruption and without need for prior setup via other parts of the library. However, higher level mu libraries usually need to store information across function calls, and the common structure for this is an initiation/termination structure, in which an initiation function is called before interacting with the library (usually at the beginning of the program's lifetime) and a termination function is called once interaction with the library is done for the program's lifetime (usually right before the program exits).

### Object referencing

Functions that rely on the initiation and termination stucture usually return types that are just macros for the `size_m` type, acting as an index referencer for later usage in different functions, following a general syntax of:

```
muObject object = mu_object_create(...);
...
...mu_object_do_something(...object...)...
...
object = mu_object_destroy(...object...);
```

In this given example, `muObject` would be a macro for `size_m`, storing some sort of number to reference this object. In these instances, the macro `MU_NONE` (which is just the maximum value `size_m` can store) is used to refer to an object that doesn't exist.

### Global context

With this structuring usually comes some global context variable (usually in the format of `mux_global_context`) which is a pointer to an incomplete type defined in the header that is filled in the implementation. This global context variable is defined in the header so that the user can check if `mux_global_context` is a null pointer (that is, 0) to verify if the library is in an initiated or terminated state.

### Non-initiation/termination-dependent functions

Most of the time, certain functions within a library are allowed to be called without the library being initialized. These functions are usually noticeable by them not using any library-defined object, instead using purely basic types, but it's always safer to check the documentation to make sure that this is or is not the case.

### Inclusion of muMultithreading

Libraries that follow this global context structure usually also have a dependency on muMultithreading. This is in order to ensure thread safety with objects passed between functions. However, muMultithreading is, on default, not defined when included in these libraries unless the macro `MU_THREADSAFE` is defined before the header of the respective library is defined.

The actual full thread safety of the library is not always guaranteed, however, even if muMultithreading is a dependency, so be sure to read up on the documentation for the library to be sure.

## Inclusion of muUtility

The library muUtility is usually included in a mu library. This library defines many of the essential things used by virtually all mu libraries, such as `size_m`, `(u)intN_m` types, `muBool`, `MUDEF`, `muByte`, et cetera. More explicit information about what muUtility provides is defined in its documentation, and if you have any questions about types and macros that you see repeated in all mu libraries, they're probably defined in muUtility and elaborated upon in muUtility's documentation.

### Usage of non-secure functions

mu libraries often use non-secure functions that will trigger warnings on certain compilers. These warnings are, to put it lightly, dumb, so the header section of muUtility defines `_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS` (unless `MU_SECURE_WARNINGS` is defined). However, it is not guaranteed that this definition will actually turn the warnings off, which at that point, they have to be manually turned off by the user.

## Result enumerator

mu libraries usually provide a result enumerator that is used to represent how a function performed. This enumerator also usually includes the enumerators for the libraries it depends on, ie, if library muX depends on muY, muX's result enumerator list most likely looks like:

```
MUX_SUCCESS,
... (other muX enumerators)

MUX_MUY_SUCCESS,
... (other muY enumerators)
```

Note that a non-success enumerator *doesn't* necessarily imply that it failed.

## Name functions

mu libraries usually provide functions for converting enumerators that they provide from their value to a `const char*` string representation. This is done for the purpose of debugging and is most useful with function result enumerator checking.

These name functions are usually only defined if a previous macro is defined, usually following the format of `MUX_NAMES`.

## Major/Minor/Patch version macros

mu libraries usually define their version in 3 respective major/minor/patch macros within the header section, usually following the format of `MUX_VERSION_MAJOR`, `MUX_VERISON_MINOR`, and `MUX_VERSION_PATCH`.

## Overridable C standard library dependencies

mu libraries usually have every single dependency on the C standard library overridable. This includes everything defined by the respective included standard file and used at some point in the library, such as functions, types, and macros.

# Documentation

The documentation provided with a mu library (usually in the form of a single file, `README.md`) explicity states what the library does and how to use it, bringing up every relevant function, variable, macro, C standard library dependency, other libraries stored within the library, struct, enumerator, et cetera.

Note that the detail about the other libraries included within itself are not provided, only the fact that they're provided and the version.

# License

A license is provided with a given mu library (stored at the end of the file and also accompanied with a `license.md` file) that is dual, one being public domain and one being MIT, with the user deciding which license to use. The idea behind this is to have a license as useable and flexible as possible, but having it only as public domain can lead to legal issues that I'm not gonna pretend like I understand :D (I'm a programmer, not a lawyer).

Note that the public domain license also allows you to include any mu library in your software without changing its license.

# Demos

mu libraries are usually provided with a folder for demos that provide example programs (with many explanation comments) that use the library in various demonstrative ways. This is provided in case the documentation isn't sufficient or you just wish to get the gist for how to use the library quickly.

# FAQ

## Why C?

C was chosen for the mu libraries due to its high compatibility with devices, libraries, and even other programming languages in many cases. C++ also has this, but to a significantly lower extent, especially in regard to compatability with other programming languages.

## Why all one file?

I'm not going to argue for or against a header-only single-file library format, as I don't think I'm personally experienced enough in the entire C/C++ library ecosystem and relevant build systems to make such a call with any degree of confidence.

What I will say is that when I'm programming in C or C++, I often find myself thinking one of two things when importing another library:

"Man, this is so easy because it's header-only single-file."

or

"Man, this sucks."

I'm sorry, but I'm a sucker for simplicity, and I've never really run into a case where I'm using a header-only single-file library and had a hard time importing or using it. For my cases, they work, and they work well, so I think that it's safe to presume that the same would apply for many others.

# Usual inner file contents

The usual inner file contents of a mu file are meant to be relatively tiny (extreme emphasis on the 'relatively' part of that sentence), which means that it doesn't contain things such as demos (see the demos section) or many explanatory comments (that's the job of the documentation).

The following is the usual inner file contents of a mu file in order from top to bottom.

## Beginning explanation comment

The file begins with the following format:

```
/*
FILENAME - AUTHOR
SHORT DESCRIPTION
No warranty implied; use at your own risk.

Licensed under MIT License or public domain, whichever you prefer.
More explicit license information at the end of file.

...
*/
```

This just gives a brief explanation of what the file is for anybody who opens it. The `...` could be virtually anything; it's usually notes such as `@MENTION ...` or `@TODO ...`.

## Header section

The next section is usually the header section of the library, being wrapped like so:

```
#ifndef MUX_H
	#define MUX_H

	...
	
	#ifdef __cplusplus
	extern "C" { // }
	#endif
	
	...
	
	#ifdef __cplusplus
	}
	#endif
#endif /* MUX_H */
```

Within the first `...` is the header section of other libraries that this library depends on, and within the second `...` is the actual contents of the header.

### Inclusion of other library headers

Other libraries' header sections are included within this section. If they've already been defined, a check for version mismatching is performed that can be turned off with `MU_CHECK_VERSION_MISMATCHING` being defined beforehand. This is, generally, what that looks like:

```
/* Library version n.n.n header */
	
	#if !defined(MU_CHECK_VERSION_MISMATCHING) && defined(LIBRARY_H) && \
		(LIBRARY_VERSION_MAJOR != n || LIBRARY_VERSION_MINOR != n || LIBRARY_VERSION_PATCH != n)
		
		#pragma message("[...] Library's header has already been defined, but version doesn't match the version that this library is built for. This may lead to errors, warnings, or unexpected behavior. Define MU_CHECK_VERSION_MISMATCHING before this to turn off this message.")

	#endif

	#ifndef LIBRARY_H
		...
	#endif /* LIBRARY_H */
```

### Version major/minor/patch definition

The major, minor, and patch macros are usually defined within the header section, following this general format:

```
#define MUX_VERSION_MAJOR n
#define MUX_VERSION_MINOR n
#define MUX_VERSION_PATCH n
```

### C standard library dependencies

Any C standard library dependencies not defined beforehand are usually defined within the header section, following this general format:

```
/* C standard library dependencies */
	
	#if !defined(mu_function) || \
		!defined(type_m)      || \
		!defined(MU_MACRO)
		
		#include <relevantfile.h>
		
		#ifndef mu_function
			#define mu_function function
		#endif

		#ifndef type_m
			#define type_m type
		#endif

		#ifndef MU_MACRO
			#define MU_MACRO MACRO
		#endif
	
	#endif
	
	...
	
```

Note that these C standard library dependencies are overridable if defined beforehand, as this formatting would suggest, and are all listed in the documentation for their respective mu library.

### Incomplete types

Most initiation/termination structured mu libraries have an incomplete type defined to refer to the global context, later defined in the implementation. It usually follows this general formatting:

```
/* Incomplete types */

	typedef struct muxContext muxContext;

```

### Global variables

Most initiation/termination structured mu libraries quickly define a global context variable pointer based on the previously defined incomplete context type, following this general formatting:

```
/* Global variables */

	MUDEF muxContext* mux_global_context;

```

### Enumerators

Most mu libraries define their enumerators within the header section, the most important of which is usually a result enumerator to check for the result of a function, following this general formatting:

```
/* Enums */

	MU_ENUM(muxResult,
		MUX_SUCCESS,
		...
	)

```

Note that this uses the `MU_ENUM` macro function provided by muUtility instead of the usual actual `enum` keyword in C because I've run into issues with MSVC and enumerators. Note that I hate Microsoft (of course, except for you, Raymond Chen).

### Macros

Most mu libraries define their macros within the header section. This is usually just filled with the object index references. It usually follows this general formatting:

```
/* Macros */
	
	#define muObject size_m
	...

```

### Functions

Most mu libraries define their functions within the header section. It usually follows this general formatting:

```
/* Functions */

	/* Names */

		#ifdef MUX_NAMES
			...
		#endif
	
	/* Initiation / Termination */
		
		MUDEF void mux_init(muxResult* result);
		MUDEF void mux_term(muxResult* result);
	
	...

```

## Implementation section

The implementation section for most mu libraries comes after the header section, following this general formatting:

```
#ifdef MUX_IMPLEMENTATION
	
	...

	#ifdef __cplusplus
	extern "C" { // }
	#endif

	...

	#ifdef __cplusplus
	}
	#endif

#endif /* MUX_IMPLEMENTATION */
```

Within the first `...` is the implementation section of other libraries that this library depends on, and within the second `...` is the actual contents of the implementation.

### Inclusion of other library implementations

Other libraries' implementation sections are included within this section. This is, generally, what that looks like:

```
/* Library version n.n.n implementation */

	#ifndef LIBRARY_IMPLEMENTATION
		#define LIBRARY_IMPLEMENTATION
		
		#ifdef LIBRARY_IMPLEMENTATION
			...
		#endif /* LIBRARY_IMPLEMENTATION */
	#endif

```

Note that there are purposefully two empty lines at the end for compilers who throw warnings or errors for a file not ending in a newline character. There are two because sometimes copying and pasting removes the last line if it's a newline character, hopefully bypassing such a check with a second newline.
